Fast Sorting Algorithms

Implement a fast sorting algorithm as described in class. Here
is some example code (Links to an external site.) to use as a guideline.
You need only implement the sorting algorithm; the main
method will be provided for you.

You must hand in the Sorts class with the
heapSort sorting algorithm implemented. This is the only
file you should hand in. The heading of the method is as in the
provided file. Do not change it or you will lose credit!
